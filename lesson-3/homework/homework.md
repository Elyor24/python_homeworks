## Topic: Lists, Tuples

## Exercises - List
1. Create a list named `fruits` that contains the following items: `'apple'`, `'banana'`, `'cherry'`. Then print the list.
2. Create two empty lists: one using square brackets `([])` and one using the `list()` function. Assign them to `empty_list1` and `empty_list2` respectively, and print both.
3. Use the `list()` function to convert the string `'hello'` into a list of characters and assign it to a variable named `char_list`. Print the result.
4. Create a list named nested that contains three lists: `[1, 2]`, `[3, 4]`, and `[5, 6]`. Then access and print the second list inside nested.
5. Given the list `colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']`, write a script to print:
    <ul>
        <li>The first element</li>
        <li>The last element</li>
        <li>The second and third elements</li>
    </ul> 
6. Create a list named `mixed` that contains the following items:
    <ol>
        <li>A string: `'Python'`</li>
        <li>An integer: `42`</li>
        <li>A float: `3.14`</li>
        <li>Another list: `[1, 2, 3]`</li>
    </ol>
    Print the `mixed` list.

7. Write a program to print all the elements of a list in single line.
    Input: 
    ```python
    num = [23,24,54,34] 
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    23  24  54  34
    ```


8. Write a program to count the number of items stored in a list.

    Input: 
    ```python
    num = [23,24,54,34] 
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    4
    ```
9. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Print the following:  
    - The first element  
    - The last element  
    - The middle element  

10. Use negative indexing to:
    - Print the second-to-last element
    - Print the list in reverse

11. Slice and print the following:
    - The first 3 elements
    - The last 3 elements
    - All elements except the first and last
12. Use slicing with steps to:
    - Print every second element
    - Print the list in reverse using slicing
13. Modify part of the list by replacing the middle three elements with zeros.
14. Remove the first three elements using slicing.
16. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list. 
17. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list. 
18. Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list. 
19. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list. 
20. Write a Python program to convert a list of characters into a string. 
21. Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a list. 
22. Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list. 

### Methods
23. Adds an element to the end of the list.
24. Sorts the list in ascending and descending order.
25. Reverses the list in place.
26. Removes and returns the element at the specified index (or the last element by default).
27. Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
28. Inserts an element at a specific position.
29. Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value.
30. Extends the list by appending elements from another iterable.
31. Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value.
32. Removes all elements from the list.
33. Returns a shallow copy of the list.

## Tuple
34. Create a tuple with the numbers 10, 20, 30. Print the type to confirm it's a tuple.  
35. Create a tuple explicitly using parentheses with the values 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'.
36. Create a tuple with a single element 42. Print its type to confirm it's a tuple.
37. Create an empty tuple in two different ways. Print their lengths.
38. Convert the list ['a', 'b', 'c'] to a tuple.
39. Access the second element of the tuple (5, 10, 15, 20).
40. Print the last element of the tuple (3, 6, 9, 12).
41. Count how many times 7 appears in the tuple (7, 1, 7, 3, 7, 4).
42. Find the index of the value 4 in the tuple (8, 4, 6, 4, 10).
43. Concatenate (1, 2) with (3, 4). Print the result.
44. Find the length of the tuple (100, 200, 300, 400, 500).
45. Unpack the tuple ('Python', 'SQL', 'HTML') into three variables and print each.
46. Unpack the tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) using x, *y, z and print y.
47. Access the element 5 in the tuple ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)).
