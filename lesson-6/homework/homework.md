## Topic: Loops

## Exercises 

1. Print first 10 natural numbers using while loop
2. Write a Python code to print the following number pattern using a loop.
    ```bash
    1 
    1 2 
    1 2 3 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 2 3 4 5
    ```
3. Write a Python program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number. For example, if the user entered 10, the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)
    ```bash
    Enter number 10
    Sum is:  55
    ```
4. Write a Python program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop. For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.
5. Print list in reverse order using a loop
6. Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
7. Display a message “Done” after the successful execution of the for loop
    Given:
    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    Done!
    ```
8. Print all prime numbers within a range.

    * Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.

    Examples:
    * 6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
    * 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.

    Given:
    ```python
    # range
    start = 25
    end = 50
    ```

    Output:
    ```bash
    Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
    29
    31
    37
    41
    43
    47
    ```

9. Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
10. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
11. Use nested loops to create the following:
    ```bash
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    # # # # # # # #
    ```
12. Print the following pattern:
    ```bash
    0 x 0 = 0
    1 x 1 = 1
    2 x 2 = 4
    3 x 3 = 9
    4 x 4 = 16
    5 x 5 = 25
    6 x 6 = 36
    7 x 7 = 49
    8 x 8 = 64
    9 x 9 = 81
    10 x 10 = 100
    ```
13. Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.
14. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
15. Use for loop to iterate from 100 to 0 and print only even numbers
16. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.
    ```bash
    The sum of all numbers is 5050.
    ```
17. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.
    ```bash
    The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
    ```
