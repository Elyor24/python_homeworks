## Topic: Classes

## Exercises

1. Write a Python program to create a class representing a Circle. Include methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
2. Write a Python program to create a person class. Include attributes like name, country and date of birth. Implement a method to determine the person's age.
3. Write a Python program to create a calculator class. Include methods for basic arithmetic operations.
4. Write a Python program to create a class that represents a shape. Include methods to calculate its area and perimeter. Implement subclasses for different shapes like circle, triangle, and square.
5. Write a Python program to create a class representing a shopping cart. Include methods for adding and removing items, and calculating the total price.
6. Python has the module called statistics and we can use this module to do all the statistical calculations. However, to learn how to make function and reuse function let us try to develop a program, which calculates the measure of central tendency of a sample (mean, median, mode) and measure of variability (range, variance, standard deviation). In addition to those measures, find the min, max, count, percentile, and frequency distribution of the sample. You can create a class called Statistics and create all the functions that do statistical calculations as methods for the Statistics class. Check the output below.

   ```python
   ages = [31, 26, 34, 37, 27, 26, 32, 32, 26, 27, 27, 24, 32, 33, 27, 25, 26, 38, 37, 31, 34, 24, 33, 29, 26]

   print('Count:', data.count()) # 25
   print('Sum: ', data.sum()) # 744
   print('Min: ', data.min()) # 24
   print('Max: ', data.max()) # 38
   print('Range: ', data.range() # 14
   print('Mean: ', data.mean()) # 30
   print('Median: ', data.median()) # 29
   ```

   ```python
   # you output should look like this
   print(data.describe())
   Count: 25
   Sum:  744
   Min:  24
   Max:  38
   Range:  14
   Mean:  30
   Median:  29
   ```

18. Write a Python program that takes a text file as input and returns the number of words of a given text file. Note: Some words can be separated by a comma with no space.
19. Write a Python program to generate 26 text files named A.txt, B.txt, and so on up to Z.txt.
